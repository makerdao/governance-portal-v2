In short, MIP4c2-SP3 proposes some minor language edits and addresses some inconsistencies detailed throughout MIP9. More specifically, the proposed change will update the MIP to be consistent in saying that the Community Greenlight process will occur before the Domain Greenlight process, that Community Greenlight Polls will run for two weeks, and separating the components to increase clarity surrounding the overall process requirements and outcomes.\n\n**Inclusion Poll Details:**\n\n- If the **Yes** votes in the inclusion poll are higher than the combination of **No** votes plus the **Default Inclusion Threshold** at the end of the poll, the proposal will be included in the Governance Poll. In summary, if **Yes** votes > (**No** votes + **Default Inclusion Threshold**) = inclusion in the Governance Poll.\n- Note that the Default Inclusion Threshold is set to **3000 MKR**.\n\n## Review\n\nThe proposal can be reviewed here: [MIP4c2-SP3: MIP9 Amendments](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/2665).
